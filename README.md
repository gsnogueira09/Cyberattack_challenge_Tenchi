# Cyberattack Challenge Tenchi (in construction)

Data Scientist selective process at Tenchi

--> Problem definition

You work for the American or the Brazilian Intelligence Agency, and your boss requested that you find useful information from a database of cyberattacks.
You have to build a small report (3-4 pages) meant to him/her and the President. The report should be written as a prose and directed to people who do not have statistical
or machine learning knowledge. You should add to this report all the relevant information you think it is important concerning the issue.  

In the repository are attached the following files:

  1. Main database (cyberattack_challenge.csv)
  2. Head descriptions of the database (head description.txt)
  3. Script with Pre-processing and Exploratory analyses (prep_and_exp_Tenchi.ipynb)
  4. Script with Detailed analyses (detailed_Tenchi.ipynb)
  5. Final Report (cyberattack_report_Tenchi.pdf)
  6. Dashboard report (dash_report_tenchi.pdf)

Main conclusions:

  1. The Administrative and Utilities sectors are the ones that need more attention from the autorities
  2. Hacktivists and Former Consultants are the agents that cause more losses through their breaches
  3. Further investigation to know what sectors inside the group "Other" sectors were attacked and who attacked them is necessary
